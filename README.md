Land Price Prediction using Machine Learning
--------------------------------------------
This project develops an AI-powered prediction model that estimates the price per cent of land based on its location and proximity to key amenities.
Using machine learning — specifically the Random Forest Regressor — the model analyzes geographical and infrastructural parameters to predict fair land prices for decision-making in real estate.

Overview
_________
The Land Price Prediction Model helps estimate the market value of land using various influencing factors such as distance to schools, hospitals, and markets.
The model is trained on the dataset land_prices.csv, containing real or simulated land data, and predicts the price per cent for new land records.

Features
__________
Predicts price per cent for a land property
Considers location and multiple distance-based features
Performs complete preprocessing, training, and prediction steps
Built using robust regression algorithms for better accuracy
